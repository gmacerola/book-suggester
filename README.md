### Summary

-When I make value judgments on various topics, I like to put them in perspective with relevant news.

-Twitter is a good repository for at least the trending topics on what people are talking about, but not necessarily fact-based.

-I wanted to take the top 5 trending topics from Twitter and just see the top 5 news articles for those topics.

-Also, I wanted the ability to see the trending topics prior to looking at articles because they not be topics I am interested in at all. I put the topics on the landing page so the user could make a decision on if they wanted to see the top 5 news articles for those particular topics or they could leave and come back later that day for a new set of topics.
